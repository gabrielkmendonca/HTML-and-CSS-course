    <h1>Paragraph and line break</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>We can write
        a paragraph anyway.
        Just
        make
        sure
        it's between the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;. <!-- '&lt' and '&gt' are used to display the simbols '<' and '>' without opening a tag-->
    </p>
    <p>If we need to line break on a specified place, such as this, <br> just use the tag &lt;br&gt;.</p>
